                Name: Isaac Black<br>
                Age: 52<br>
                Location: Bonners Ferry, Idaho<br>
                Occupation: Student - bus driver<br>
                I enjoy programming and have started a youtube channel recently. I am usually a very busy guy with little time for the video games I used to enjoy a lot. I have 2 wonderful children over 18. My daughter is working in San Antonio, Texas. My son is Autistic and lives with his biological mother. I enjoy helping others and always try my best to be honest in every situation. There are times I feel that I get passed over or not considered because of this but I refuse to stop doing my best to be honest in every situation. I have been adding random text and it never seems to be enough. Maybe I should just increase the size of the font.

                The part of Idaho I live in is deep in the Rocky mountains. The Idaho panhandle is only about 25 miles wide and wedged between 2 mountain ranges. There is lots of wildlife and many small lakes. The hunting and fishing is second to none.
