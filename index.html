                I enjoy programming and have started a youtube channel recently. I am usually a very busy guy with little time for the video games I used to enjoy a lot.

                The part of Idaho I live in is deep in the Rocky mountains. The Idaho panhandle is only about 25 miles wide and wedged between 2 mountain ranges. There is lots of wildlife and many small lakes. The hunting and fishing is second to none.
